How do I post and manage Buyer Requests?

If you have trouble finding what you are looking for or have a special request, you can submit a Buyer's Request. This allows you to send your request to the Fiverr community. If your request meets the criteria of a seller, the seller will submit an offer, which you can review and approve if it meets your needs.

 To request a specific service:
1. Once logged in, click on your profile picture and choose Post a Request from the drop-down menu.
2. In the description area, write what you are searching for.
For example, if you are looking for a logo, you can specify your company name, business type, preferred color, etc. If you'd like, you can attach a file.
Note: You can only attach files up to 1 GB.
3. Select the category and subcategory of your request.
For example, if you are looking for a logo, you should choose "Logo Design" within the "Graphics & Design" category.
Note: In some categories, you may be asked to provide additional information (criteria).
4. Select when you would like your service delivered once you place your order.
You can select 24 Hours, 3 Days, 7 Days, or select Other and specify a delivery time between 1 and 90 days.
5. Enter your budget for the service you are requesting.
6. Click Post.

Your request will be labeled Pending until Fiverr approves it. If your request is not approved, it will be labeled Unapproved and you will get an email explaining why it wasn't approved.   You can also review our article Tips to create a Buyer Request for more information on this. 

Note: once submitted a Buyer Request cannot be edited, it can only be deleted.




# How do I manage the offers I'm getting to my Buyer Request?
You thought out your needs, placed a concise request with all the information clearly stated, and you were respectful in your request.
Now the bids start coming in. What do you do?

* First, eliminate the ones from sellers you know did not read your request. You want sellers who show they understand your needs, addressed how they can help solve them, and shared experience to back that up.
* Second, visit the sellers you think have merit. Read their reviews, study their Gigs, and if you like them, favorite them by clicking on the heart icon found on the top right corner of their Gigs.  

Continue this process until you have a handful of potential candidates. From here, you have two options. Option one is to message the sellers and find out more about how they can help, what it will cost, and what samples they have if not already provided. Option two is to order $5 basic Gigs from each seller as a test. See what the experience is with each, and choose your preferred seller.
If you are still getting flooded with bids, you can pause your request. You do not have to make a decision or respond to each proposal as they come in. 




# How do I manage my Buyer Requests?
### Tools to manage your requests: 

1. Once logged in, click on your profile picture and choose the option **Manage Requests** from the drop-down menu.
2. If your request is approved, in the **Action** drop-down list, you can select:

* **Pause** if you want to pause your request due to too many offers, for example.
* **Boost** if you want to push your request to the top of the list of requests.  This is done by updating the date of the request to be the "Boost" date. You can boost each approved request only once. The label, "Boosted," will appear next to your request if you select this action.
* **Delete** if you want to remove your request.

Note: Buyer requests with no new activity (i.e., new offers or boosting) will expire after 14 days.


1. If your request is approved, and sellers have sent their bids, click **Review Offers.**
You will see the number of offers your request has received so far next to the button. 
2. To sort your offers by date, price, delivery time, ratings, or reviews, click the **Sort Offers by** drop-down list.
3. To accept a Gig, click **Order Now.** 
If you wish to review the seller's profile prior to purchasing, click on their username.  This will take you to the seller's Gig page, where you can find more information about the seller.
If you would like to communicate with the seller before ordering, click on contact me.

Note: To remove an offer, click **Remove Offer.** This will allow you to see more offers in place of the offers you remove.



### The possible Buyer Request statuses are:
* Active: This means your Gig request is available and can be viewed by sellers as an active request. 
* Paused: This means your Gig request is not active and not available to sellers. For example, if you have enough offers on your request, you can pause your request.
* Pending: Once you submit a request, the status is pending until Fiverr approves it.
* Unapproved: If your request doesn't meet the proper criteria from our content team, it will be labeled Unapproved.

**Not what you're looking for?** You can always browse their marketplace through their search feature.
